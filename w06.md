# Top 10 List of Week 06

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 06!

Daemon is a background process that can't be touched by the users.

**Interesting Reason:** My teaching assistant talked about the daemon, about how a daemon should have its parent killed 💀, but then I asked about whether it's an orphan or not? Turns out it will be taken over by the init systems. So, by watching the video you will understand how it works. The video will summarize all important concepts by talking about Daemons and the Init Systems.
