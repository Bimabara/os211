# Top 10 List of Week 02

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 02!

## 1. [Public Key Cryptography: RSA Encryption Algorithm (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8)

This is a **MUST WATCH** video! Mathematics never seem to stop impressing me. This video explain the RSA Encryption algorithm which was founded in the **1970s**, (still about 50 years old from now, so young ðŸ˜²) RSA uses the fact that computers are good at multiplying, but bad at prime factorizing a number. With the fact, Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman develops an encrypting system which is widely used. Until now.

## 2. [GPG Tutorial (Interactive + Documentations)](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/gpg-tutorial)

The interactive module is [here](https://www.igolder.com/PGP/). Both of the links contain basic function on GPG, pretty straightforward. You can also try to encrypt and decrypt a message with the module ðŸ”‘. So fun!

## 3. [theZoo (Github Repository)](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)

It contains some malware sample (974.45MB Repo size) you can checkout and even run on your computer! Alternatively, [**MalwareDatabase**](https://github.com/Endermanch/MalwareDatabase) also got some cool resources! I will definitely try to run WannaCryptor â˜£ (The famous ransomware) if I have a free time ðŸ¦ .

## 4. [Bitcoin Mining in 4 Minutes (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTC31ZI6QM4)

Do you know that SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) is related to bitcoin mining? Yeah, neither do I. Computerphile is the best computer science channel out there! I love their channel. Also check [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY), a video by them that is closely related to the bitcoin one ðŸ’°. For you math nerds, you **MUST** check this video from 3B1B as well! [How secure is 256 bit security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY)

## 5. [SSH Tunneling Explained (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtuAdk4MwWw)

I recently tried to use *kawung* and *badak*, the command `scp` and `rsync`. SSH Tunneling is a way to access a blocked from outside server but you know there is a way to connect from a secure shell, somehow **TO** that server. The video briefly explains SSH Tunneling and give you some hind insights about how it works and how to do it. For port references, you can read it [here](https://www.meridianoutpost.com/resources/articles/well-known-tcpip-ports.php).
