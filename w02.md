# Top 10 List of Week 02

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 02!

## 1. [Public Key Cryptography: RSA Encryption Algorithm (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8)

This is a **MUST WATCH** video! Mathematics never seem to stop impressing me. This video explain the RSA Encryption algorithm which was founded in the **1970s**, (still about 50 years old from now, so young ðŸ˜²) RSA uses the fact that computers are good at multiplying, but bad at prime factorizing a number. With the fact, Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman develops an encrypting system which is widely used. Until now.

## 2. [GPG Tutorial (Interactive + Documentations)](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/gpg-tutorial)

GPG stands for **GNU Privacy Guard**, it's a CLI app used to encrypt, decrypt and maintain your PGP key. The interactive module is [here](https://www.igolder.com/PGP/). Both of the links contain basic function on GPG, pretty straightforward. You can also try to encrypt and decrypt a message with the module ðŸ”‘. So fun!

## 3. [theZoo (Github Repository)](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)

It contains some malware sample (974.45MB Repo size) you can checkout and even run on your computer! Alternatively, [**MalwareDatabase**](https://github.com/Endermanch/MalwareDatabase) also got some cool resources! I will definitely try to run WannaCryptor â˜£ (The famous ransomware) if I have a free time ðŸ¦ .

## 4. [Bitcoin Mining in 4 Minutes (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTC31ZI6QM4)

Do you know that SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) is related to bitcoin mining? Yeah, neither do I. The creator of the Bitcoin protocol, **Satoshi Nakomoto**, chose to use the **SHA-256 hash function** as the basis for Bitcoin mining. Computerphile is the best computer science channel out there! I love their channel. Also check [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY), a video by them that is closely related to the bitcoin one ðŸ’°. For you math nerds, you **MUST** check this video from 3B1B as well! [How secure is 256 bit security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY)

## 5. [SSH Tunneling Explained (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtuAdk4MwWw)

I recently tried to use *kawung* and *badak*, the command `scp` and `rsync`. SSH Tunneling is a way to access a blocked from outside server but you know there is a way to connect from a secure shell, somehow **TO** that server. The video briefly explains SSH Tunneling and give you some hind insights about how it works and how to do it. For port references, you can read it [here](https://www.meridianoutpost.com/resources/articles/well-known-tcpip-ports.php). ðŸŽ¯

## 6. [corkami/collisions (Github Repository)](https://github.com/corkami/collisions)

Don't play with fire, don't rely on MD5. MD5 is a widely used hash function. But, it suffers from some bad. By bad I mean **REAL BAD** vulnerabilities. The repo collects some existing hashing attacks, and some instant collisions script generator of any JPG, PNG, PDF, MP4, PE... - and also explore in detail common file formats to determine how they can be exploited with present or with future attacks ðŸ¦ŸðŸ‘¾.

## 7. [How Do Linux File Permissions Work? (Article)](https://www.howtogeek.com/67987/htg-explains-how-do-linux-file-permissions-work/)

Ever make a `script.sh` file and when you tried to `./script.sh` it but you got a permission denied message? or have you tried to ssh a remote shell but you got an unsafe permission? `chown` Will change **who** owns the file and what group it belongs, while `chmod` changes **how** the owners and groups can access the file (or if they can access it at all). The article will explain to you briefly how file permission in Linux works.

That's all Week 2 from me. I'll start doing Week 3 as soon as possible!

Peace out!
