# Top 10 List of Week 04

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 04! Minggu-minggu sebelumnya ialah minggu yang tangguh, kita membahas tentang File Systems dan bagaimana struktur File secara umum. Materi minggu ini ialah Main Memory, kalau menurut buku Silberschatz. Namun tertulis *Topic* pada slide ialah Addresing, Shared Lib, dan Pointer. Nah, berikut ialah daftar dari beberapa link yang bagus menurut saya untuk minggu ini. 😁

## 3. [Compiling, assembling, and linking (Video + Forum Discussion)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2y6csonII4)

So, beyond an assembler turning a source into an object binary file, there's actually a *linker* that makes ca program executable. So, you might ask, [What do linkers do?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3322911/what-do-linkers-do) To understand it, let's say you have a hello world program, consists of a line `printf("Hello Venti!\n");`  when it is compiled, it simply puts only a reference to the `printf` function, and then the linker will resolve this reference. **It "copies" all the necessary stuffs and references to create a single executable. **It's interesting, knowing that programs is actually not that simple and turns out they actually being heavily optimized by the compiler and operating systems 🤡!

## 7. [Make File (Colored Documentations + Forum)](https://makefiletutorial.com/)

So, make file is essentially a script that lets you `make file`, usually it consists of some several commands to let you compile something or just **arrange some things into a/some file(s)**.  [what is the difference between a makefile and a shell script?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3798562/why-use-make-over-a-shell-script) The answer is: It's easier, and makefile is dedicated for it. There are even topological features which lets you save a progress if it's already been done, or lets you run some different flags when making those files 📁. It's interesting because. Well, now you can understand what makefile(s) files are in our Demos Mr. RMS provided 😊😊.
