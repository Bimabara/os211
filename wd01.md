# Top 10 List of Week 01

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 01. ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³. I barely experienced a Linux operating system. I'm not really familiar with the terms yet. By terms I mean like *Linux*, *UNIX*, *GNU/Linux*, *Kernel*, and some others ðŸ˜•. In this post I tried to use Bahasa Indonesia. But the terms are complicated. Instead I will use bahasa campuran. Also this Top 10 won't be sorted by "The best and the most important". Instead, it's my "Top 10", sorted (almost) chronologically among others good GSGS stuffs.

## 1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)

This is my baby step ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£.

Mengarahkan kepada link yang berisikan video berdurasi 13 menit, dengan dijelaskannya apa itu Sistem Operasi, apa gunanya secara umum, bagaimana sejarahnya dan bagaimana berkembangnya hingga sekarang. Pada awalnya sistem operasi dimulai dari keresahan para *programmers* karena perlunya berbagai penyesuaian berbeda untuk setiap hardware. ðŸŒ 

Akhirnya dibuatlah sistem operasi yang bisa menjadi semacam perantara antara hardware dan program aplikasi, yang menyediakan semacam antarmuka (*interface*) yang semakin berkembang dan semakin rumit, menyediakan berbagai kegunaan, seperti memory management, resource management yang mengizinkan adanya multitasking menggunakan 1 CPU. ðŸ’»

## 2. [Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing vs Multitasking vs Multithreading](https://www.javatpoint.com/multiprogramming-vs-multiprocessing-vs-multitasking-vs-multithreading)

This is an article, the title and the content is self explanatory. Quite obvious. This explains all the differences between the "Multi" terms that we've heard. TL;DR **Multiprogramming** is where there is multiple programs running in the main memory. **Multiprocessing** is multiple processors that is used to run several instructions of a program in parallel. **Multithreading** is dividing processes into threads which has its own path of execution. **Multitasking** is when several users executing something in memory.

## 3. [Regex Golf](https://alf.nu/RegexGolf)

It's a regex practice website. You can solve some regex puzzle while learning it. People even make a dedicated github repo of the bests [solutions of RegexGolf](https://gist.github.com/Davidebyzero/9221685).

## 4. [Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)

As we all know, there are a thing called **Virtual Memory **and **[System Call](https://www.guru99.com/system-call-operating-system.html)** in Operating systems. Instead of letting a process uses some other addresses in memory, it will set up an environment which lets the process to only "Fight" ðŸ¥Š in its area, that's called the virtual memory, it's basically a mapping system which lets a virtual address instead of physical address, which then will be translated into real physical address that is allocated to a process. The mapping ðŸ—º is done by the [memory management](https://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/~yliu/teaching/os/lec12.html) unit (MMU), and is known as **paging technique**. Not only on the main memory, this virtual memory also treats part of a secondary memory as the "main memory". The process can also do a limited subsets of instructions (so it doesn't crash the whole system), and is called a dual mode operation system. Which will next be explained in number 4. 

## 6. [Cloud Service Models](https://www.javatpoint.com/cloud-service-models)

In terms of computer system environments, one of the most significant ones is cloud computing. It is a virtualization based technology that allows us to develop stuffs over the cloud A.K.A the Internet. There are three types of cloud service models, and each of which has its own characteristics.

## 10. [Operating System Concepts - Tenth Edition](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/)

OK this might be cringe. But yes, I'm putting this **(Kudos for Mr. Silberschatz and friends)**. But, at first I was really confused on how should I study for this Operating Systems class. I was losing hope as I was thinking why does the topic so diverse. Do I have to browse it independently? ðŸ˜­

> Close your eyes, let me tell you. You can study from here. I thought this link was just an advertisement. But turns out the book itself was all the study references guided from Mr. Rahmat's slides.

You must check out the exercises, study guide, and slides for regular studying. I'll try to keep the lists free from basic lecture notes stuffs and start exploring! (I'm trying hard to study properly for this course because I think Operating Systems are cool ðŸ˜Ž).

If you want to hear some extra explanation, I found [California State University Stanislaus **John SarraillÃ©**'s notes on Operating Systems](https://www.cs.csustan.edu/~john/Classes/CS3750/Notes/). He's a professor there teaching Operating Systems giving free screencasts of the Silberschatz' book. I found  the notes as a total help for a shrimp like me.

There is also a free Lecture uploaded by Mr. Hamid Mukhtar of Taif University in [OS Fall 2019 - CIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6w6JowO5Fw&list=PLBpMYKycVdGb3tlVlmR9Rmx47p6UOVp7W).

Also here [CS-342 Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ci5g49nfdE&list=PLhwVAYxlh5dsX6aOfVMZXS8MwKwBmwVM6), a lecture by Asst. Prof. Dr. Ä°brahim KÃ¶rpeoÄŸlu from Bilkent University, Department of Computer Engineering.

Also [Fundamentals of Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJTqTs7Ujr8&list=PLW1yb8L3S1ngGmtKlI5XYcTNQQ1r3xZvq), and [OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAT70fxe_Fo&list=PL9P1J9q3_9fOTGzsBCn0T2T5vHLdBcDq_).

That's all Week 0 and 1 from me. I'll start doing Week 2 as soon as possible!

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
