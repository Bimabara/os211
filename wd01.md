# Top 10 List of Week 01

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 01. ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³. I barely experienced a Linux operating system. I'm not really familiar with the terms yet. By terms I mean like *Linux*, *UNIX*, *GNU/Linux*, *Kernel*, and some others ðŸ˜•. In this post I tried to use Bahasa Indonesia. But the terms are complicated. Instead I will use bahasa campuran. 

## 1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)

This is my baby step ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£.

Mengarahkan kepada link yang berisikan video berdurasi 13 menit, dengan dijelaskannya apa itu Sistem Operasi, apa gunanya secara umum, bagaimana sejarahnya dan bagaimana berkembangnya hingga sekarang. Pada awalnya sistem operasi dimulai dari keresahan para *programmers* karena perlunya berbagai penyesuaian berbeda untuk setiap hardware. ðŸŒ 

Akhirnya dibuatlah sistem operasi yang bisa menjadi semacam perantara antara hardware dan program aplikasi, yang menyediakan semacam antarmuka (*interface*) yang semakin berkembang dan semakin rumit, menyediakan berbagai kegunaan, seperti memory management, resource management yang mengizinkan adanya multitasking menggunakan 1 CPU. ðŸ’»

## 2. [Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing vs Multitasking vs Multithreading](https://www.javatpoint.com/multiprogramming-vs-multiprocessing-vs-multitasking-vs-multithreading)

This is an article, the title and the content is self explanatory. Quite obvious. This explains all the differences between the "Multi" terms that we've heard. TL;DR **Multiprogramming** is where there is multiple programs running in the main memory. **Multiprocessing** is multiple processors that is used to run several instructions of a program in parallel. **Multithreading** is dividing processes into threads which has its own path of execution. **Multitasking** is when several users executing something in memory.

## 10. [Operating System Concepts - Tenth Edition](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/)

OK this might be cringe. But yes, I'm putting this **(Kudos for Mr. Silberschatz and friends)**. But, at first I was really confused on how should I study for this Operating Systems class. I was losing hope as I was thinking why does the topic so diverse. Do I have to browse it independently? ðŸ˜­

> Close your eyes, let me tell you. You can study from here. I thought this link was just an advertisement. But turns out the book itself was all the study references guided from Mr. Rahmat's slides.

You must check out the exercises, study guide, and slides for regular studying. I'll try to keep the lists free from basic lecture notes stuffs and start exploring! (I'm trying hard to study properly for this course because I think Operating Systems are cool ðŸ˜Ž).

If you want to hear some extra explanation, I found [California State University Stanislaus **John SarraillÃ©**'s notes on Operating Systems](https://www.cs.csustan.edu/~john/Classes/CS3750/Notes/). He's a professor there teaching Operating Systems giving free screencasts of the Silberschatz' book. I found  the notes as a total help for a shrimp like me.

There is also a free Lecture uploaded by Mr. Hamid Mukhtar of Taif University in [OS Fall 2019 - CIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6w6JowO5Fw&list=PLBpMYKycVdGb3tlVlmR9Rmx47p6UOVp7W).

Also here [CS-342 Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ci5g49nfdE&list=PLhwVAYxlh5dsX6aOfVMZXS8MwKwBmwVM6), a lecture by Asst. Prof. Dr. Ä°brahim KÃ¶rpeoÄŸlu from Bilkent University, Department of Computer Engineering.

Also [Fundamentals of Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJTqTs7Ujr8&list=PLW1yb8L3S1ngGmtKlI5XYcTNQQ1r3xZvq), and [OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAT70fxe_Fo&list=PL9P1J9q3_9fOTGzsBCn0T2T5vHLdBcDq_).

That's all Week 0 and 1 from me. I'll start doing Week 2 as soon as possible!

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
